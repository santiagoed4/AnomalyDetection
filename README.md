# Review of machine learning models with applications to asset integrity of offshore subsea equipment

Subsea equipment is part of a complex asset integration where safety, environmental and operational parameters require continuous monitoring.  Multiple subsea stations have been developed for oil and gas production with high safety standards. However, any misbehavior or deviation of parameters could represent a natural disaster. Therefore, detecting anomalies contribute extensible in the asset integrity of these complex projects. A possible scenario to improve the parameters supervision is proposed in this research with machine learning anomaly detection algorithms to minimize the incident likelihood. Training machine learning models to learn the normal state and identify the divergent pattern is valuable. Literature review of machine learning and applications in subsea is classified where convolutional neural networks and in general artificial neural networks dominated in the implementations. Wellhead case study included the analysis of flow prediction with better performance for extreme gradient boosting (R2: 0.97 and RMSE: 1188). In the case of anomaly detection, simultaneous algorithms will improve the detection of misbehavior. The methods detected between 9 and 13 anomalies over 182 points. Results indicated that just one method could miss the detection of a critical event. The research outcome offers an overview of machine learning models that could improve the integrity of complex systems. 

### Assistance and design tools

Google Colaboratory allows to develop the coding task of machine learning models. Consequently, the following packages will be used: Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms, Pandas for data extraction and preparation and, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization as well as Bokeh for interactive visualization, and Keras and Tensorflow for deep learning algorithms.
